AB  - The success of foundation models such as ChatGPT and AlphaFold has spurred 
      significant interest in building similar models for electronic medical records 
      (EMRs) to improve patient care and hospital operations. However, recent hype has 
      obscured critical gaps in our understanding of these models' capabilities. In 
      this narrative review, we examine 84 foundation models trained on non-imaging EMR 
      data (i.e., clinical text and/or structured data) and create a taxonomy 
      delineating their architectures, training data, and potential use cases. We find 
      that most models are trained on small, narrowly-scoped clinical datasets (e.g., 
      MIMIC-III) or broad, public biomedical corpora (e.g., PubMed) and are evaluated 
      on tasks that do not provide meaningful insights on their usefulness to health 
      systems. Considering these findings, we propose an improved evaluation framework 
      for measuring the benefits of clinical foundation models that is more closely 
      grounded to metrics that matter in healthcare.
